                    <h3>World <br>of tanks</h3>
                    <p class="intro">For years, World of Tanks has been the go-to game for epic battles featuring
                        historically accurate armored vehicles. Experience driving a multi-ton,
                        cannon-equipped behemoth into combat against teams of tankers from all over the world.
                        World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition was made from the ground-up, with every part of the game
                        ratcheted
                        up
                        for explosive showdowns like no other. </p>

                    <h3>Massive <br>team battles</h3>
                    <p class="intro">It's great to dream of being the ace who saves the day, but it's only through
                        teamwork
                        that you and your
                        allies prevail. 30 tanks split between two teams battle for supremacy on over a dozen
                        intricately-designed maps. Do your best to collaborate,
                        and your allies will work with you to unleash an unstoppable assault against your enemies!</p>

                    <h3>Multiple <br>game<br> modes</h3>
                    <p class="intro">World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard,
                        Encounter, and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt
                        to secure the opposing base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture,
                        and teams fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between
                        attackers and defenders during a single-base engagement.</p>
